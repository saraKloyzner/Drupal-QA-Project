# Drupal Q&A Website

## Project Description

The Drupal Q&A Website is a web application designed to facilitate the display and interaction of questions and answers. This project enables users to view questions organized by topics, filter questions by category, and expand or collapse answers for a cleaner user experience. The site leverages the powerful capabilities of Drupal along with a React application for a dynamic and responsive frontend.

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for creating a progressive web app within Drupal.
- **DDEV**: A local development environment for managing Drupal projects.
- **Composer**: A dependency manager for PHP, used to install and manage Drupal modules.
